# Sampling_methods_for_arch_pred_mod
R code used for the analysis and modeling described in the manuscript "Sampling Methods for Archaeological Predictive Modeling: Spatial Autocorrelation and Model Performance"
1.	JAS_setup.R loads in and prepares the data for the predictive modeling. There are also some lines of code here that perform some preliminary analysis, for familiarizing ourselves with the data.
2.	JAS_classifiers.R builds and runs the classifiers, having loaded in a data frame created by JAS_setup.R. It also calculates and saves sets of AUCs generated by running the models on testing data sets.
3.	JAS_plots.R, using the AUCs generated by JAS_classifiers.R, creates the AUC plots featured in Figure 5.
4.	JAS_autocorrelation.R performs the t-tests for site heterogeneity in the independent variables. It also calculates Moranâ€™s I values for the independent variable values pertaining to the sites.
